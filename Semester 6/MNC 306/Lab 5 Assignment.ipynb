    "Proper imputation methods can reduce the bias introduced by missing data. Without imputation, the analysis might be based on a non-representative subset of the data, leading to incorrect conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Preserving Data: \n",

    "Imputation can lead to improved model accuracy by providing a more complete dataset. This allows the model to learn from all available information, rather than just a subset.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Reduced Bias:\n",
    "Proper imputation methods can reduce the bias introduced by missing data, leading to more reliable and generalizable models.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Handling Missing Data During Prediction:\n",
    "Imputation methods can be applied consistently during both training and prediction phases, ensuring that the model can handle missing data in new, unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Potential Risks:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Incorrect Imputation: If the imputation method is not appropriate for the data, it can introduce bias and lead to incorrect conclusions. For example, using mean imputation for data that is not normally distributed can distort the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Overfitting: Imputation can sometimes lead to overfitting, especially if the imputed values are not representative of the true underlying data distribution.\n",
